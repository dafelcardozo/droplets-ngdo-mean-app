The Droplets sample application is a tool which provides a cetain bridge between patients and volunteer bloood donors, by enabling them to share their locations in a cloud web map.

You can check the live demo for the Droplets-ng2-mean-app sample application at this URL: http://ec2-52-91-71-144.compute-1.amazonaws.com/gis

The always changing rdepository for the source code of this sample application is hosted at GitHub, at this URL: https://github.com/dafelcardozo/droplets-ngdo-mean-app.

Credits and thanks to the software tools and providers which I used to build this application. I am somehow ashamed to say that they are just so many:

- Arc GIS Online platform which provides all of the cartography of this web map: https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html
- The OpenLayers 3 API, which encapsulates all kinds of mapping sources under a comprehensible API: http://openlayers.org/en/v3.9.0/apidoc/
- The MEAN.JS boilerplate team which inspired the module structure and documentation of this sample project: http://meanjs.org/
- The Generator ng-Fullstack saved me days and days of work with their unique code generation tools for Typescript and Node.js applications: http://ngmodules.org/modules/generator-ng-fullstack
- The Yeoman scaffolding tool which is the main scaffolding tool for modern webapps: http://yeoman.io/generators/
- The Atom.io hackable text editor and the Notepad++ Windows editor: https://atom.io/
- The MongoDB database: https://www.mongodb.com/es
- The sockets.io 1.0 chat API: http://socket.io/
- The Git protocol and GitHub platform, the most important code sharing and hosting tool in the world: https://github.com/
- Amazon AWS and EC2 containers, which host this application in their cloud service, the biggest one in the world: https://aws.amazon.com/es/
- The Angular 2 and Node.js platforms, each of those are the two biggest software frameworks client and server side in the world today: https://angular.io/ and https://nodejs.org/en/
- The Typescript and Javascript languages, in wich this sample application is entirely written. More about those here; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript and there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
- and the countless other software tools and platforms that I use everyday while building software.


As part of this sample application are the following documents:

- system design document.
- screens design document.
- the building, deploying and running instructions.



And very special thanks to Crossover and all of the people who will evaluate this tool !
